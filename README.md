# Common-Password-Checker

I created program that prompts the user to provide a password, and then print out the common passwords most similar to the password the user provided.

Example program execution:

Give me a password: josh
You provided a password of josh
The most similar passwords to josh are:
fish, john, joshua, 
All of which are 2 character(s) different.
